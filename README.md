# Tracitor - a <a href="https://www.tracery.io/" target="_blank">Tracery</a> editor
### What is this?
An editor for <a href="https://www.tracery.io/" target="_blank">Tracery</a>, made with a simple UI.
### Installation
You can use this application by doing one of the following:
- Visit the <a href="https://theawesomefufuman.github.io/Tracitor/" target="_blank">web version</a> of the project
- Download the repository and open index.html
### Usage
#### JSON editor
The JSON editor works the same way as <a href="https://www.tracery.io/" target="_blank">Tracery</a> does. Fill in your Tracery grammar JSON object and click on 'üìñ Generate story'. The start symbol for the Tracery grammar is always 'origin', so make sure that you have a symbol called 'origin' that refers to the rest of your symbols for the application to work. The button titled 'üìã Copy JSON to the clipboard' copies the JSON object to the clipboard for use and/or storage outside of this application.

#### Simple editor
The simple editor works in a similar way to the JSON editor. You create a symbol by giving it a title in the first field and a rules in the second field(separated by commas). To add another symbol, click the button titled '‚úîÔ∏è Add another symbol'. Once your symbols are all set up, you can put it all together in the big textarea below the symbol input fields by refering to the symbols by their name(s) surrounded with '#'s, e.g. #animal# for a symbol with the title 'animal'. Finally you click 'üìñ Generate story' to see the result. The button titled 'üìã Copy JSON to the clipboard' copies the template for your current story to the clipboard for use and/or storage outside of this application. To import a saved story, paste the information in the JSON editor and click on 'üìñ Generate story'.

#### View generated story
Here you will see the result of the generated story that you have created. Click on 'üìã Copy the story to the clipboard' to copy the story in the textarea. Click on 'üìñ Reroll story' to generate a new random story from the symbols that you have created in either the JSON editor or in the Simple Editor.
